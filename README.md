# **Analysis of Nigerian Food Prices**

#### Nigeria has been facing food price inflation for the past few years, coupled with economic crises and poverty.

#### It is also no news that the country has been fighting insecurity in form of insurgency, gang activities and an uptick in general social crimes.

#### Analysis of available data shows that much of Nigeria's food-producing states are battling these violent activities.
 

## **Datasets**
#### For this analysis, I depended on the data from Nigeria's National Bureau of Statistics [NBS](https://nigerianstat.gov.ng/elibrary/read/1241203), which collects and publishes food prices across the country every month. This data has been consistent for more than 5 years and in this analysis, I used the food price index data from 2017 to  July 2022. This main data was then split into smaller datasets used in the analysis. 
##### I needed another data that gives an insight into the security issues of Nigeria, the best I could find is the Council on Foreign Affairs which collates data on different forms of violent activities in the country and I used its security tracker data.
